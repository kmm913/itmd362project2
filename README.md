# ITMD 362 Project 2 Self-Critique

Our group put a lot of work into this project, and I'm happy with my contributions and with the way the final product turned out. I contributed heavily to the task analysis and the user testing process (Project 3), and I figured out how to get the accordion menus working on the calendar/projects/syllabus pages. Along with Deboarh, I also co-managed the team's Github repository and functioned as a co-project manager for the project overall.

My biggest challenge (and biggest area for improvement) is definitely in delegating tasks and/or trusting my teammates. This is no fault of theirs, they worked hard, this is a personal anxiety issue which I need to work on if I'm going to be involved in more group project settings one day. 

My biggest take away from this semester is to stop and think before you just start developing a website. Think about who will use the site, what you're trying to get them to do, and how you can design your site to accomplish that goal--don't just think about how pretty it can look or how smooth or clever your JavaScript can be. I've learned to design a site first for mobile phones and then scale up to tablets/laptops and desktops; I've learned to pay attention to the minor details because it could be something you consider small that your users love or hate; most importantly, I think I've become a more thoughtful designer in a general sense, even for projects beyond this class, and that is an invaluable skill.
